# zach-allen-portfolio

This challenge consisted of possessing no starter code and instead us relying on our knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a website essentially from scratch that serves as a portfolio for ourselves as professionals in the coding world. Since only one challenge has been completed at this point in the journey, only one project appears as authentic while the rest contain placeholder images with generic names. Features of CSS were utilized such as media queries, flexbox, and active links on the page. 

Sample code distributed by Byron Ferguson found in Folder in Repository entitled "Sample-code". 

Assistance with challenge was given by the TAs of Bootcamp program, as well as tutor Meg Meyers, though code was not directly sent and then copied & pasted whatsoever.
